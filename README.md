# Huffman-encoding-decoding
Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,  contributed to the design and development of the Huffman-encoding-decoding web applications. The goal of the project is to provide users with an intuitive interface for efficiently compressing and decompressing text files. Key responsibilities include implementing key functions, integrating the Huffman coding algorithm, and enhancing the user experience by providing real-time feedback and visualizing the Huffman tree structure.

# Key Contributions
Developed JavaScript logic to handle file uploads, encoding, and decoding processes.
Utilized the FileReader API to read and process uploaded text files.
Implemented dynamic elements to display the Huffman tree structure and operation information.
Ensured user-friendly alerts for scenarios such as empty or missing uploaded files.
Created a file download function for saving compressed and decompressed data as downloadable files.
Employed CSS to style the web application with a responsive and visually appealing layout.
